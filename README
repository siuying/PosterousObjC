Adding PosterousObjectiveC to your project:

1. Download PosterousObjectiveC source to your computer

2. Locate folder "PosterousAPI" under "PosterousObjectiveC/Classes". Drag and drop it into your project. A dialog will appear -- make sure "Copy items" is checked, "Recursively create groups for any added folders" radio button is selected, "Reference Type" is "Default" before clicking "Add".

3. Right click on the "Frameworks" group in your project and select Add > Existing Frameworks. Then locate the following frameworks and add them to the project (if they do not already exist in your application):
- CFNetwork
- SystemConfiguration
- MobileCoreServices
- CoreGraphics
- libz.1.2.3.dylib

4. IMPORTANT: Go to the PosterousAPI/Helper Classes/Constants.m file and add your Posterous username and password to the Username and Password constants.

NSString * const Username = @"your posterous username";
NSString * const Password = @"your posterous password";

1. Import PosterousClient.h in the header class of the controller that will use this library.

#import "PosterousClient.h"

3. Create an instance of PosterousClient within your method

4. Call a Posterous Client method within the same method you created an instance of PosterousClient:

//example code here

(All calls are asynchronous)

5. Add the response type you will be retrieving in the header class of the controller that will use this library
